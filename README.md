# Wombat

Dark gray color scheme for Vim and GVim sharing some similarities with Desert.

Wombat features a dark gray background and an easy to view color selection.

This is a modification of [Vimscript 1778](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1778).

This colorscheme works with xterm, xterm256, and GVim.

Enable this colorscheme by copying this file to `~/.vim/colors` (or your OS equivalent) and using the vim command:
`colorscheme wombat`

This colorscheme closely ties to [vim-airline's wombat](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) colorscheme.

## Features/Additions

- Fully supported by xterm, xterm256, and GVim
- Optional 'ColorColumn', highlighting the 81st char in a line
- Special syntax highlighting schemes
- Updated Diff highlighting
- Spellchecker highlighting (if spellchecker is enabled)
